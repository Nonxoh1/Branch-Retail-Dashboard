<h1>BRANCH RETAIL DASHBOARD Dashboard</h1>

 ### [DASHBOARD LINK](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/ed74aad2-a5db-4a6f-af18-315c1246378f/70c55a5f1ecd488d3dec?experience=power-bi)

<h2>Description</h2>
This Power BI dashboard was created to track deposit mobilization performance at LAPO Microfinance Bank, Dawson Branch. The goal was to provide a clear picture of how much each Customer Service Officer (CSO) contributed to total deposits within a selected period.


<br />


<h2>ðŸ“‚ Tools & Technologies Used</h2>

- <b>SQL (Oracle): For data extraction/b> 
- <b>Microsoft Excel: Light cleanup before import</b>
- <b>Power BI Desktop: For visuals, KPIs, and interactivity</b>
- <b>DAX: To calculate totals, ratios, and conditional values</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>Steps Followed:</h2>

<p align="center">
Step 1:Understanding the Business Need
<p align="left"><br>The objective was to help regional and branch-level stakeholders visualize and track the total deposits mobilized across various channels, zones, and states, focusing on clean credit transactions within the core banking system. This would support better strategy planning and performance monitoring.

</br>


<p align="center">
Step 2:Data Extraction via SQL (Oracle Database)
<p align="left"><br>I wrote and executed a custom SQL script (see https://github.com/Nonxoh1/Branch-Retail-Dashboard/blob/main/DEPOSIT%20MOBILIZE.sql) to extract credit-only deposit transactions.</br>


<p align="left">Key filters applied:

Date range: 1st JAN 2024 â€“ 31ST AUG 2024

Transaction type: Only non-reversal CREDITS (drcr_ind = 'C')

Excluded: VAT, SMC, SDC, internal user IDs, and specific product types like NOSTRO, MOBILE WALLETS, CALL, TERM DEPOSITS, etc.

The script also joined relevant tables to get:

Zone, State, and Area from the sttm_branch_custom table

Branch codes and account details from sttm_cust_account
</br>
<p align="center">
Step 3: Data Cleaning & Aggregation
<p align="left"><br>Used GROUP BY to summarize total LCY deposit amount per branch, zone, and state.

Removed duplicates and validated transaction integrity using business logic.

Exported the result as an EXCEL file from SQL Developer.</br>
<p align="center">
Step 4: Data Modeling in Power BI
<p align="left"><br>Imported the cleaned EXCEL File into Power BI.
Defined proper data types (e.g., branch as text, amount as decimal).

Created relationships between dimension tables with other tables because i made use of two data. Example is New clients mobilized by each CSO in the bank.(see https://github.com/Nonxoh1/Branch-Retail-Dashboard/blob/main/NEW%20CUSTOMERS%20CREATED_ONBOARDED.sql)</br>

<p align="center">
Step 4: Dashboard Development
<p align="left"><br>Designed a clean and executive-friendly layout to highlight:
Total Deposits Mobilized
Top Performing Zones
Performance by State and Area
Branch Contribution Breakdown
Used bar charts, cards, a ranking system of top and bottom performing CSO's and slicers for interactivity and insight filtering as shown below

Step 5: How I Ranked CSO Performance<br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nGltAkv.jpeg" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Dashbaord Design"/>
 
 <p align="left">To make the dashboard more interactive and flexible, I built a dynamic DAX formula that lets users rank CSOs either by Top Performers or Bottom Performers, depending on what they choose from a slicer.

This means you can switch between:

Seeing the highest-performing CSOs (based on total deposits), or

Seeing the lowest-performing CSOs, if you're trying to identify underperformance

Here's a breakdown of what the DAX formula does:

Ranks All CSOs
-First, I used the RANKX function to assign a rank to each CSO based on how much deposit they brought in:

-One rank is for top-down (highest to lowest)

-Another is for bottom-up (lowest to highest)

Takes User Input from a Slicer
I created a slicer called "Choose Rank Type" with options like "Top" and "Bottom".

Whatever the user selects tells the DAX function which rank to apply â€” so the logic reacts dynamically.

Shows Only the Selected Number of CSOs
Another slicer called "Choose Rank Value" allows the user to select how many CSOs they want to see (e.g., Top 5, Bottom 10, etc.).

Returns Total Deposit Only If Rank Is in Range
If a CSO falls within the selected rank range (e.g., Top 5), then their total deposit is shown.
If not, theyâ€™re hidden from the visual.

âœ… Final Thoughts
This dashboard wasnâ€™t just built to look good â€” it was created to solve a real problem. It gives the Dawson branch team a clear way to see how much deposit each CSO is bringing in, whoâ€™s performing well, and where thereâ€™s room for improvement.

By combining SQL, Power BI, and a bit of DAX logic, I was able to turn raw transaction data into something managers can actually use â€” whether itâ€™s for performance reviews, strategy planning, or just keeping track of progress toward monthly targets.

This project is a good example of how data can help teams work smarter, not harder.
